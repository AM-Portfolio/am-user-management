WHAT I DID - SHORT SUMMARY
===============================

ADDED 1 ENDPOINT TO AM-USER-MANAGEMENT:
- GET /internal/v1/users/{user_id}
- Returns user details for JWT token creation
- Called by auth-tokens service to validate users

MICROSERVICE INTEGRATION COMPLETE:
3-Step Authentication Flow Now Works:
1. POST localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login (get user_id)
2. POST localhost:8080/api/v1/tokens/by-user-id (create JWT)
3. POST localhost:8080/api/v1/validate (validate JWT)

UPDATED DOCUMENTATION:
- Added internal endpoint to POSTMAN collection
- Updated implementation summary with JWT integration
- Documented complete microservice workflow

FILES CHANGED:
- main.py (added internal endpoint)
- POSTMAN_API_TESTING.md (added JWT workflow)
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.txt (updated with integration)

RESULT:
Your AM-User-Management + AM-Auth-Tokens services now work together 
as a complete microservice authentication system!

Ready for testing the complete JWT authentication flow!
